# Smart Recording Light

A project to turn a standard LED light (or any other mains appliance) into a recording light controllable by recording in Logic Pro X, connected via MIDI to a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W. The default configuration also includes a visible light strip, via a Pimoroni Blinkt, to supplement the main light. This project uses a TP Link Kasa plug for mains control, but is easily adaptable to work on any kind of smart plug via Home Assistant's API, Zigbee2MQTT or similar.
